    "description": "Denarius - The name of my application originates from a silver coin used in ancient Rome as a form of payment. This web app assists its users in managing their finances. The client-side of the app after logging in can set up saving goals they wish to achieve by a certain date and track their expenses. The backend then takes care of storing that data and performing all of the calculations upon a specific endpoint request call. That data is then presented to the user for their viewing. The web app can also track the information of the top 20 trading Cryptocurrencies and updates the list every 2 minutes by pulling the data from coinmarketcap.com using the CoinMarketCap API.",
